            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>The phoenix is an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology (with analogs in many cultures) that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 
            Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. </p>
            <p>The phoenix bird symbolizes immortality, resurrection and life after death, and in ancient Greek and Egyptian
             mythology it is associated with the sun god. According to the Greeks, the bird lives in Arabia, near a cool well.</p>
            <p>A phoenix is a mythical bird with colorful feathers and a tail of gold and scarlet. In the ancient Greek and Egyptian mythologies, 
            it is described as a large bird, much like an eagle, with supernatural powers to come back to life.

            </p>
            <p>Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.</p>
